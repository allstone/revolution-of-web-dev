*"I start nearly all my talks like this: "My name is Ben Orenstein and I work for thoughtbot. This talk is about why vim is the greatest text editor ever written. The most important thing for you to take away from this talk is X."

One sentence intro. One sentence summary. Third sentence is the most important idea of the talk."*


## Intro

My name is Mark Erikson, and  I work for the BACN program as part of the BIB application team.  This talk is about the tools, technologies, and concepts involved in modern web development.  The most important things for you to take away from this talk are:


- The tools and technologies used to build web applications have changed dramatically in the last few years
- The modern web development technology ecosystem includes a wide variety of tools, approaches, and concepts that are commonly used or considered to be "best practices"
- These modern tools and technologies can be complex, but also enable building powerful and complex web applications that weren't previously possible, as well as development techniques that improve development speed and maintainability
